### EKS Cluster

- 🟢 **MINOR:** LiteLLM: Tracking spending in error (do we want disable it or wait for it?)

- 🔴 **HIGH:** CRUD: Exercise 6: The test seems to run successfully, but it doesn't actually update the document with _id: 20000000. When I checked with Cline, that document doesn't seem to exist.
- 🔴 **HIGH:** CRUD: Exercise 7: The test runs successfully but also fails to insert a review for the document with _id: 20000000, likely for the same reason.

### AWS

- ❄️ **FROZEN:** OIDC: Ask if it is possible to have OIDC (current SA profile does not allow).
