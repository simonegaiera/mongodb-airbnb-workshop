## Docs

### Navigation
- ❄️ **FROZEN:** When Lucene is unpinned need to change the search index definition removing facets and keeping only token
- ❄️ **FROZEN:** Exercise with RankFusion

---

## App

- 🟠 **MEDIUM:** Implement the skill badges into the Arena
- 🔴 **HIGH:** Aligning Arena with badges (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O6sqz99ws4fIOKuVuGlCTt8ouf6F1f1CnryrXaI8b5I/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=113368862675613286241)
- 🟠 **MEDIUM:** Add a new exercise on Agentic
- 🔴 **HIGH:** Cutomer was not able to check th status of the exercise, but leadboard was working. Change the GET to POST to avoid this and investigate more. Maybe add a details page in the portal if it happens again.

---

## Server

- 🟠 **MEDIUM:** Add java, not only Javascript

### Cline
- 🔴 **HIGH:** Fix: I have the file open and can either implement the full function (modify code) or provide a guided hint only — the repository's .clinerules prefer mentoring over providing full exercise solutions. Ask the user which they want so I proceed correctly. 

---

## Arena Portal

### Portal
- 🟡 **LOW:** Options to upload custom banners, titles, and logos to match an event or sponsoring company's branding

### Admin
- 🔴 **HIGH:** User status progress and errors. We want to understand where they are stuck.

## Terraform

### Atlas cluster
- ❄️ **FROZEN:** (When auto-embedding is GA) Bring back the Atlas resource for project! Now is using an already created project because of auto-embedding!
- ❄️ **FROZEN:** When Lucene is unpinned need to change the search index definition removing facets and keeping only token
- ❄️ **FROZEN:** What if I want to use a different dataset? Add this capability

### EKS Cluster
- 🔴 **HIGH:** Check that the "app" is working for all, if 500 should be an error. Need to find a way to see if the workspace was created correctly.


## Kanopy

### Deploy
- ❄️ **FROZEN:** Deploy on Kanopy
