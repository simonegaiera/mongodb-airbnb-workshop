# MongoDB AI Arena Environment Setup Guide

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Reminder that this process is automating the creating of a number of cloud resources; please remember to destroy this (details below) when your work is complete!

## Prerequisites

### Python 3
1. **Verify Python 3 Installation**  
   Make sure Python 3 is installed on your machine.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   Use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

### Terraform and Terragrunt
1. **Install Terraform**  
   ```bash
   brew tap hashicorp/tap
   brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
   terraform --version
   ```
   To upgrade:
   ```bash
   brew upgrade hashicorp/tap/terraform
   ```

2. **Install Terragrunt**  
   ```bash
   brew install terragrunt
   terragrunt --version
   ```
   To upgrade:
   ```bash
   brew upgrade terragrunt
   ```

## Environment Configuration

1. **Copy Files**  
   - Navigate to `utils/arena-terragrunt`
   - Duplicate the `airbinb` folder and rename it with your `customer` name.
      > Do not use capital letters or special characters in the customer name
      > For a fully managed solution, keep all folders.  
      > For a hybrid approach, which doesn't include VSCode Online, remove the `eks-cluster` folder.
   - Open the `root.hcl` and update the `remote_state.config.key` value and replace the `"customer"` portion with your `customer` name.

2. **MongoDB Atlas Configuration**  
   - Navigate to the new `customer` director and then go in the `atlas-cluster` directory.
   - Update `user_list.csv` with the list of attendees.  
   - In `terragrunt.hcl`, replace placeholders `public_key` and `private_key` with your MongoDB Atlas API key and modify the `project_name` with your Atlas cluster project name.
      > ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Now is a good time to make sure both the database and the API key allow access from 0.0.0.0 to supported both the Kubernetes cluster and the eventual end users. 
      > Other variables can be modified if necessary, but are not required
   - By default, a new Atlas Project is created. To use an existing project instead, the project must be imported before applying (see Terragrunt command below)
   - If you need to invite users, uncomment `mongodbatlas_project_invitation`. By default, no invitations are sent.

3. **EKS Configuration (Skip for Hybrid)**  
   - In the `eks-cluster` folder, update `terragrunt.hcl` with your `customer` name, `aws_region`, and `domain_email`.  
   - Choose the workshop scenario by creating a `scenario.json` file in the `eks-cluster` folder.  
      > Example templates include `"vibe-coding"` and `"guided-exercises"`, which can be copied to `scenario.json` as a starter
      > If you do not remove the core airbnb folder, make sure to create a `scenario.json` file there, too!
      > The scenario configuration is now loaded from this JSON file via the `scenario_config` input in `terragrunt.hcl`.
      > For any scenario, you can leave the `sections` in the `instructions` field as empty arrays (`[]`) if you do not want to include specific content for those sections.
   - **Leaderboard Type:** The leaderboard can be either **timed** (default) or **score** based. Set this in your scenario configuration as needed.
   ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Note that the cluster expires after one week by default.

## Deployment and Management

1. **Login to AWS SSO**  
   Follow the documentation [here](https://wiki.corp.mongodb.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=109642642&spaceKey=10GEN&title=SA%2BAWS%2BAccess%2B-%2BUpdated%2BNov%2B2020) for detailed steps on logging into AWS SSO.  
   Once you have completed the steps, use the following command:
   ```bash
   aws sso login --profile Solution-Architects.User-979559056307
   ```

2. **Initialize**  
   ```bash
   terragrunt init --all --upgrade
   ```

3. **Plan**  
   ```bash
   terragrunt plan --all
   ```

   If you want to use an existing Atlas project (instead of creating a new one), import it before applying:
   ```bash
   terragrunt import --working-dir=atlas-cluster mongodbatlas_project.project <project_id>
   ```

4. **Apply**  
   ```bash
   terragrunt apply --all
   ```

   - **NOTE:** In most cases, you only need to run the default apply command below to deploy all modules.  The following commands are for advanced or specific scenarios.

      - **To apply a specific module:**  
      Replace `<module-directory>` with the desired module folder:
      ```bash
      terragrunt apply --working-dir=<module-directory>
      ```

      - **To taint (mark for recreation) a specific resource in the EKS module:**
      ```bash
      terragrunt run --working-dir=eks-cluster -- taint '<resource.name>'
      ```

         > ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Always run `terragrunt plan --all` before applying to review the changes that will be made.

      - **To remove a resource from the Terraform state using Terragrunt:**  
      This is useful if you need to "forget" a resource without destroying it.  
      Replace `<module-directory>` with the relevant module folder and `<resource_address>` with the resource to remove:
      ```bash
      terragrunt run --working-dir=<module-directory> -- state rm '<resource_address>'
      ```

5. **Destroy**  
   - **To destroy all modules:**  
     ```bash
     terragrunt destroy --all
     ```
   - **To destroy a specific module:**  
     Replace `<module-directory>` with the desired module folder:
     ```bash
     terragrunt destroy --working-dir=<module-directory>
     ```

**Destroy resources only when they are no longer needed.**
