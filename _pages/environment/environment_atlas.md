## Environment Preparation: Atlas

### Workshop: Validate your Atlas Cluster

Before you begin, you need to be able to access your environment. Follow these steps to validate your environment:

1. **MongoDB Atlas Connection String**: You will receive a connection string to connect to your MongoDB Atlas cluster.
2. **Database Access**: You will be provided with a username and password to access the database.
3. **Atlas Access Credentials**: Although not required, you may receive credentials to access MongoDB Atlas.

### Self-Paced: Create an Atlas Cluster

If you prefer a self-paced approach, you can create your own Atlas cluster and load the Sample Dataset. Follow the [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) to create a cluster and load the sample data.
