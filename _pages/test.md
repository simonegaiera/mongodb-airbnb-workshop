# Test Your Results

To ensure that your exercise is complete and all functions are working as expected, you can run the provided test suite. Follow these steps to test your results:

1. **Run Tests**: Execute the test suite by running:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Review Test Results**: The test suite will automatically validate each function you were asked to modify. The output will indicate whether each test has passed or failed.

3. **Completion Criteria**: The exercise is considered complete if all tests pass successfully. A positive result for all tests means that your implementation meets the required specifications.

4. **Troubleshooting**: If any tests fail, review the error messages and make the necessary adjustments to your code. Re-run the tests until all of them pass.

By following these steps, you can confidently verify that your changes are correct and the exercise is complete.
