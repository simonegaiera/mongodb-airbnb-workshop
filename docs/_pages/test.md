## Validate Your Results

To confirm that your exercise is complete and your code works correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Test Suite**  
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   This will automatically check each function you modified.

2. **Review Your Test Results**  
   - Passed tests indicate that your implementation meets the requirements.  
   - Failed tests will provide error messages to help identify issues.

3. **Completion Criteria**  
   - The exercise is considered complete when all tests pass.  
   - If any test fails, review the errors, update your code, and re-run the tests.

4. **Troubleshooting**  
   - Check that you are in the correct directory before running the tests.  
   - Confirm that all required dependencies are installed.

Following these steps ensures your changes are correct and the exercise is successfully completed.
