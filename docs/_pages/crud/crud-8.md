## 🚀 Goal: Delete Documents Like a Pro

Your platform is thriving, but sometimes it’s time to say goodbye—maybe a listing is no longer available, or a guest wants their data removed. As the backend engineer, you ensure your platform stays clean, relevant, and trustworthy by handling deletions quickly and safely.

In this exercise, you’ll master the art of deleting documents by their ID. With MongoDB, you’ll keep your data fresh and your users confident that their information is always up to date.
