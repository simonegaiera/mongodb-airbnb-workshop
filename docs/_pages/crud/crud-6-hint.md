## Hint: MongoDB `updateOne` Operation with `$set`  

For more detailed guidance on the `updateOne` operation and the `$set` operator, refer to the following MongoDB documentation links:  
- **updateOne**: Learn how to update a single document in a collection that matches the specified criteria.  
  [updateOne Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateOne/)  
- **$set**: Understand how to modify the value of a field in a document.  
  [$set Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/update/set/)  

### Using Dynamic Keys with `$set`

When using the `$set` operator, you can dynamically specify the key (field name) you want to update. This is particularly useful when the field name is stored in a variable. 

For example, you can use the following syntax:

```javascript
{ [key]: value }
```

In this code:
- `key` is a variable that holds the name of the field you want to update.
- `value` is the new value you want to assign to that field.

This allows you to create flexible update operations where the field to be updated can change based on your application logic.
