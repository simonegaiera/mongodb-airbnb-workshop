## 🛠️✨ CRUD Operations: Building the Foundation

Your company has just set out on its journey to conquer the short-term rental market. The first step? Laying the groundwork for your platform by mastering the basics of MongoDB. Just like building a house, you need a solid foundation—and that starts with CRUD: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

In this chapter of your story, you’ll take on the role of a backend engineer, shaping the data that will power your rental application. Each operation you master brings your company closer to launching a platform your users will love.

Here’s what you’ll tackle:

- 🔍 **Read**: Discover and explore the listings, bookings, and guests in your database.
- ➕ **Create**: Add new properties and guests, growing your company’s offerings.
- 📝 **Update**: Keep your data fresh by editing and improving records as your business evolves.
- 🗑️ **Delete**: Clean up outdated or incorrect information to keep your platform running smoothly.
