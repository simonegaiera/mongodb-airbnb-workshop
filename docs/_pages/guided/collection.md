## üß™ Understanding Your MongoDB Collection

Before you start querying or building features, it‚Äôs important to know **what‚Äôs inside your database**.

#### 3. Review the Response

- Cline will analyze your collection and return a summary of the main fields, their types, and example values.
- Look for:
  - **Top-level fields** (e.g., `name`, `address`, `reviews`)
  - **Nested fields** (e.g., `address.street`, `reviews.rating`)
  - **Data types** (string, number, array, object, etc.)
