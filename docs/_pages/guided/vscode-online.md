## üîó Step 3: Connect the MongoDB Extension

1. **Grab Your Connection String:**  
   - Open `/server/.env` and copy your MongoDB URI:
     ```markdown
     MONGODB_URI=`mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net`/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```

2. **Connect in VSCode:**
   - Click the **MongoDB extension** in the sidebar.
   - In **CONNECTIONS**, hit the **+** and choose **Connect with Connection String**.
   - Paste your URI and connect!

3. **Success Check:**
   - If you see your databases, you‚Äôre ready to roll!

## üîó Step 4: Use MongoDB Playground

1. **Open the MongoDB Playground:**  
   - In VSCode Online, locate and open the file `mongodb-playground.mongodb.js` (usually found in the bottom left of the Explorer).
   ![MongoDB Playground](../../assets/images/playground.png)

2. **Set Your Database:**  
   - Find the line:
     ```js
     airbnb_database = 'sample_airbnb';
     ```
   - Replace `'sample_airbnb'` with your own database name:
     ```js
     airbnb_database = '<username>';
     ```

3. **Run Your First Query:**  
   - Click the **Play** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button at the top right of the editor to execute the playground script.

4. **Check the Results:**  
   - If your query runs successfully and returns data from your database, you‚Äôre all set!
   - If you see errors, double-check your database name and connection.

## üîó Step 5: Use Cline for Bedrock AI

1. **LaunchCline:**  
   - Click the **Cline** icon in the toolbar to open the extension.
   - Select **Use your own API key**.


2. **Configure the API:**
   1. Set **API Provider** to **Amazon Bedrock**.
   2. Choose **AWS Profile** as the authentication method.
   3. Choose **AWS Region** closest to you.
   4. Enable the **Use cross-region inference** option to automatically route requests to the best available region.
   5. Select **Let's go!**

3. **Save and Test:**
   - Click **Save** to apply your settings.
   - Try a quick prompt in Cline to confirm everything is working! I generally ask to tell me a joke.
