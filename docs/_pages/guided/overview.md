## 🗺️ Arena Overview

Your mission is to build out the backend of your rental platform, focusing on the controllers that power your application. The project is split into a **frontend** and a **backend**—but your focus will be on the backend, where the real data magic happens.

1. ✏️ **CRUD Operations** – Master creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents in MongoDB.
2. 📊 **MongoDB Aggregations** – Unlock powerful data insights using the aggregation framework.
3. 🔎 **Atlas Search** – Add lightning-fast, full-text search to your app.
4. 🧠 **Vector Search** – Supercharge your platform with semantic search and AI-powered recommendations, enabling features like an in-app chatbot that can answer user questions.
