## ðŸš€ Goal: Enable Semantic Search with Atlas Vector Search Indexes

Your business wants to deliver smarter, AI-powered search experiencesâ€”helping users find the perfect stay, even when they use natural language. To unlock this, youâ€™ll create a **Vector Search index** in MongoDB Atlas. As the backend engineer, youâ€™re laying the foundation for semantic search and conversational AI.

In this exercise, youâ€™ll configure a vector index that enables semantic search on your listingsâ€™ descriptions, using MongoDBâ€™s built-in embedding model, and add a filter field for property type.

### ðŸ§© Exercise: Create Your Vector Search Index

Follow these steps:

1. **Open Atlas Search**
   - In your MongoDB Atlas cluster, in the **Services** section navigate to the **Atlas Search** tab.
   - Select the database and click **Go to Atlas Search**

2. **Create a New Index**
   - Click **Create Search Index**.
   - Choose **Vector Search** as the index type.
   - Select **"I want to semantically search text fields"**.
   - The **Index Name** should be `vector_index`
   - Select your database and click **Next**

3. **Configure the Index**
   - **Text Field Path:** `description`
   - **Embedding Model:** Keep the **recommended** model (default).
   - **Filter Field Path:** `property_type`

4. **Save and Build**
   - Click **Create Index** to start building your vector index.

5. **You can now run the tests:**  
   ```bash
   npm test -- --test=vector-search
   ```

### ðŸš¦ What to Expect

Once your vector index is live, your platform will be ready for:
- **Semantic search** that understands user intent, not just keywords.
- **AI-powered chatbots** that can match guest queries to the best listings.
- **Faster, more relevant results** by filtering on property type.
- The foundation for advanced, conversational discovery experiences.

With this step, youâ€™re not just indexing dataâ€”youâ€™re enabling the next generation of search and AI on your platform.
