### ✨ Example: Vector Search Index Definition

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "path": "description",
      "model": "voyage-3-large"
    },
    {
      "type": "filter",
      "path": "property_type"
    }
  ]
}
```

💡 Use vector fields for semantic search and filter fields to narrow down results by specific criteria.
