### 🧩 Exercise: Semantic Search Like a Pro

1. **Open the File**  
   Head to `server/src/lab/` and open `vector-search-1.lab.js`.

   Locate the `vectorSearch` function.

3. **Shape the Pipeline**  
   - Add a `$vectorSearch` stage using your vector index.  
   - Use the `description` field as the vector search path.  
   - Pass the user’s query string as the `query` parameter.  
   - Add a filter on `property_type` for more relevant results.  
   - Set `numCandidates` to 100 and `limit` to 10 in the `$vectorSearch` stage.
