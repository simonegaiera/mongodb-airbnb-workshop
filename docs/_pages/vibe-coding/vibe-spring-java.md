## ü§ñ Java Spring Boot Implementation Prompt - Part 1: Core Application & Listings & Analytics

Copy the prompt below and use it with your AI assistant:

```
Create a Java Spring Boot REST API application based on the swagger.json specification file - PART 1: Core Application Setup and Listings & Analytics Operations.

**Core Requirements:**
- Read and analyze the swagger.json file to understand all API endpoints
- Build a Java Spring Boot web application using Spring Boot on port 5000
- **Implement ONLY the CRUD and Results APIs from the swagger.json file - skip search, vector search, and chat endpoints for now**
- Organize code into proper Java packages based on the API categories you identify from the swagger
- Separate concerns: CRUD operations and results management using Spring Boot best practices

**Key Implementation Areas for Part 1:**

1. **CRUD Operations**: Standard database operations for listings and reviews using Spring Data MongoDB
2. **Statistics**: Statistical analysis using MongoDB aggregation framework
3. **Results**: Workshop participant management

**Implementation Scope:**
- **Focus on Basic Operations**: Implement listings CRUD, reviews CRUD, statistics, and results endpoints only
- **Skip Advanced Features**: Do not implement search, vector search, or chatbot endpoints in this part

**MongoDB Integration:**
- Use Spring Data MongoDB for database operations
- Use the available MCP (Model Context Protocol) to thoroughly analyze and understand the collection schemas before implementing any queries
- **Schema Discovery First**: Query the MCP to examine the actual data structure, field types, and document format in the collection
- Implement proper database queries based on the actual collection structure and field types discovered through MCP
- Ensure all field references and data types match the real database schema, not assumptions

**Database Collection Usage:**
- **Primary Collection**: All listing-related endpoints (`/api/listingsAndReviews/*`) use the `listingsAndReviews` collection
- **Results Data**: Only the Results endpoints (`/api/results/*`) use data from the `airbnb_gameday` database

**Required Deliverables for Part 1:**
1. **Complete Java Spring Boot application** with proper package organization
2. **Basic MongoDB indexes** for performance optimization of CRUD operations
3. **pom.xml file** with necessary dependencies for Spring Boot, MongoDB, and basic operations
4. **application.properties** or **application.yml** configuration file

**Environment Configuration:**
Load configuration from environment variables or application.properties:
- MONGODB_URI and other basic configuration
- Use Spring Boot's @ConfigurationProperties or @Value annotations
- Support for existing `.env` file structure

**Spring Boot Features to Implement:**
- **@RestController** for REST endpoints
- **@Service** for business logic
- **@Repository** for data access
- **@Configuration** for configuration classes
- **@Component** for utility classes
- **@Autowired** for dependency injection
- **@Valid** for request validation
- **ResponseEntity** for proper HTTP responses
- **@CrossOrigin** or global CORS configuration
- **@ExceptionHandler** for error handling

**MongoDB Integration:**
- Use **MongoTemplate** for complex aggregation queries
- Use **MongoRepository** for simple CRUD operations
- Use **@Document** annotation for entity mapping
- Use **@Field** annotation for field mapping
- Use **@Id** for document identifiers

**Additional Features:**
- Proper exception handling with @ControllerAdvice
- Request/Response validation using Bean Validation
- Environment-based configuration support
- CORS for frontend integration
- Logging with SLF4J and Logback
- Health check endpoints with Spring Boot Actuator

Analyze the swagger.json file first, then design and implement the core Java Spring Boot application with CRUD operations and results management.
```

## ü§ñ Java Spring Boot Implementation Prompt - Part 2: Search & Vector Search

Copy the prompt below and use it with your AI assistant (after completing Part 1):

```
Extend your existing Java Spring Boot REST API application with Search and Vector Search capabilities - PART 2: Search Implementation.

**Prerequisites:**
- You should have completed Part 1 with the basic Spring Boot application and CRUD operations
- The core application structure and MongoDB integration should be in place
- Use the available MCP (Model Context Protocol) to thoroughly analyze and understand the collection schemas before implementing any queries

**Key Implementation Areas for Part 2:**
1. **Atlas Search**: Implement using MongoDB Atlas Search operators (autocomplete, facet, text search)
2. **Vector Search**: Implement using MongoDB Atlas Vector Search with automated embeddings
   - **Embedding Field**: Configure automated embeddings on the `description` field for semantic search capabilities

**Implementation Scope:**
- **Add Search Endpoints**: Implement all search-related endpoints from the swagger.json file
- **Atlas Search Integration**: Add lexical search capabilities
- **Vector Search Integration**: Add semantic search capabilities

**Atlas Search & Vector Search Requirements:**
- **Vector Search Index**: Create a separate vector search index specifically for the `/vectorsearch` endpoint with automated embeddings on the `description` field
- **Lexical Search Index**: Create a single Atlas Search index that supports all lexical search operations (`/search`, `/facet`, `/autocomplete`) using appropriate operators and analyzers

**Atlas Search Field Mappings:**
- **name** (for autocomplete): Enable autocomplete search on listing names
- **amenities** (for filtering): Support faceted filtering by available amenities  
- **property_type** (for filtering): Allow filtering by property type categories
- **beds** (for numeric filtering): Enable range filtering on number of beds

**Vector Search Configuration:**
- **numCandidates**: Set to 100 for optimal performance and accuracy
- **limit**: Return top 10 most relevant results
- **Embedding Field**: Configure automated embeddings on the `description` field

**Required Deliverables for Part 2:**
1. **Extended Service Classes** with search functionality
2. **New Controller Methods** for search endpoints
3. **mongodb_indexes file** containing search-specific indexes:
   - One comprehensive Atlas Search index for all lexical search operations (search, facet, autocomplete) with proper field mappings
   - One dedicated Vector Search index for semantic search with automated embeddings on the `description` field
   - Include clear comments and creation instructions

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- Use Spring Data MongoDB aggregation framework for complex search queries
- Separate filtering/statistics from advanced Atlas Search operations
- Use appropriate MongoDB operators for each search type
- Ensure the single Atlas Search index supports text operators, autocomplete operators, and facet operators with proper field mappings
- Create a dedicated vector search index separate from the lexical search index
- Implement custom repository methods for Atlas Search and Vector Search

**Additional Dependencies:**
Update your pom.xml with any additional dependencies needed for advanced search operations.

Extend your existing application with comprehensive search capabilities using Atlas Search and Vector Search.
```

## üîç Automated Embeddings Implementation Note

**Automated embeddings is a newer MongoDB Atlas feature**. If your AI assistant doesn't implement automated embeddings correctly or lacks current documentation knowledge, use this enhanced prompt:

```
@web Reference the MongoDB Atlas Vector Search automated embedding documentation at https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/atlas-vector-search/automated-embedding/ for implementation details. Use curl to retrieve the information, not chromium.
```
